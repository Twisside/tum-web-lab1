    <h2>Timciuc Ana-Maria :)</h2>
    <p>Student at UTM, Faculty of Computers, Informatics and Microelectronics</p>
    <h4>Short Introduction</h4>
    <p>I am software engineer student passionate about solving various problems and finding solutions to them, Looking forward to being involved in minor and major development projects and extending my knowledge and abilities with newly discovered techniques and technologies.
        I started with some university project and am getting ready for something more challenging.
    </p>
    <h4>Skills</h4>
    <p>C#/.NET</p>
    <p>Python</p>
    <p>C/C++</p>

    <p>Flexible</p>

    <h4>Experience</h4>
    <p>University projects</p>
    <p>Some major projects I worked on:
        Unity game of life group project. I worked on the overall game template ready for modifications and addition of new rules;
        RSA encryption and decryption;
        Language automatons creation, conversion, etc. </p>
    <p>Personal projects</p>
    <p>An attempt to recreate an auto-chess game in python. The concept was on a hexagonal grid to have some characters on different teams “fighting” until one team is last standing. The purpose of the project was to mostly reverse engineer some mechanics and have my own “playground” for trial and errors in a new field.</p>
    <p>A mini personal project for own use based on python. The role of the project is to get a set of links of youtube playlists that are then downloaded and converted to mp3 format. Useful for me in case I go on a trip where i don’t have access to internet and can have my favorite music with me. Since it accepts playlists it allows me to avoid working with each video individually. I used python because of it’s large amount of libraries that make the process easier. </p>
